<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Physics-informed neural network (PINN)
This repository consists of several files related to a Physics-informed neural network project. this cod solves laminar flow in 2d channel. This is a basic code hence the sophisticated version of this code which will focus on 3d turbulent flow.

### Built With
_CFD solver [Openfoam](https://openfoam.com)_ v2012

_PINN code [python + pytorch](https://python.org)_ version 12


For running this code you needt o install yjese libraries
  ```sh
  pip install torch pandas numpy sklearn
  ```
